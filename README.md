#### 1.Data Collection: 
I used the GitHub API to gather data on users in Hyderabad with over 50 followers, including their profile details and information on their public repositories.

#### 2.Insight: 
Noticed that users with longer bios tend to have more followers, showing that sharing more about themselves could help attract followers.

#### 3.Recommendation for Developers:
Developers who want more followers should try writing a detailed bio and keep their repositories active with features like projects and wikis enabled.
